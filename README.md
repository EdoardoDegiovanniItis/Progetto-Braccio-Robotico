### Description:

Our project should recreate a garbage truck thanks to the use of the Dagu Rover 5, the Arduino and a robotic arm that can collect metal objects thanks to the presence of a magnet.


### Objective:

Our goal was to create a truck that could be moved using switches and a robotic arm that could be moved by joysticks.

### Components:

* [Dagu Rover 5](https://www.robotics-3d.com/international-robot-kit/203-dagu-rover-5-robot-platform.html)
* [Prusa i3 MK3s](https://www.prusa3d.com/it/prodotto/stampante-3d-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3/)

### Software needed:

* Arduino IDE, version used: [click here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* UltiMaker Cura, version used: [click here](https://ultimaker.com/it/software/ultimaker-cura/)
* you must have also a browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc.

### Development:

After deciding the roles we each began to develop our parts and we helped each other with the errors that we had during the development. 


### How to use the project:

1. Download the final project from the main branch.
2. Search the internet for the pieces that can make up a small robotic arm.
3. Download the last version of Arduino IDE.
4. Download the last version of UltiMaker Cura.
5. Start Arduino IDE and open the code that you downloaded.
6. Create the circuit following the the photo that you can find the zip.folder (buy 2 or 3 batteries 9 V).
7. Have fun collecting metal objects!
